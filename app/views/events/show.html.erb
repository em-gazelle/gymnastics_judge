one day.... this'll all be in a ReactJS - type div, updating on the right side of the 'new' page as the user adds more / less / plays with the elements to each routine. They click add, and that element's 'video' (stick figure, maybe, doing XYZ on that event) will be added to the 'index' of all those elements.......thus resulting in a single 'video' consisting of multiple 'videos' of each element, all mashed up one after another.

Optionally, each element will have a boolean of 'connected?' which, if checked, will tell the mashup video (v1+v2+v3) to speed the transition (or add more/less seconds between each video?) between v1/v2 (the elements)


for now....a YouTube link :)
